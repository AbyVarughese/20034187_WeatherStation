Starter- Weather Station

Version 1: Starter
The application launches and reads a YAML file (.yml) of readings for a small number of
weather stations. Each reading consists of:
• Weather Code (number in range 100-800), integer
• Temp (C) decimal
• Wind Speed (kM/hr) decimal
The application then presents these readings on a dashboard.
